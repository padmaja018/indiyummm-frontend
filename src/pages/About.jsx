  <h3>About Indiyummm</h3>

  <p className="about-text">
    Indiyummm was born from a simple belief — that real taste comes from purity, 
    tradition, and love. In a world filled with preservatives and artificial 
    flavors, we bring you the authentic goodness of homemade chutneys and pickles, 
    crafted exactly the way our mothers and grandmothers made them.
  </p>

  <p className="about-text">
    Every product is prepared in small batches using 100% natural, premium-quality 
    ingredients sourced directly from farmers. No shortcuts. No chemicals. 
    Only honest flavors that remind you of home.
  </p>

  <p className="about-text">
    Our mission is to keep the essence of Indian kitchens alive — the aroma of 
    freshly ground spices, the comfort of traditional recipes, and the joy of 
    sharing food that’s made with care.
